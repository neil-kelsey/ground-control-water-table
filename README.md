# Water Table!

Our satellite products are used across the world for environmental, industrial and IoT applications; in many cases they're used to periodically capture and transmit remote sensor data. Typical monitoring applications include: oil/gas pipelines, glaciers, oceanic buoys and river sensors.


We're looking for a new screen to present and visualise the data from such a sensor; it should be both highly functional and look great too!


**Key Requirements**
* Consume JSON sample data and decode sensor data
* Present the data in tabular form; with appropriate:
  * Formatting/styling for data types
  * Arrangement and presentation
  * Search/filtering capabilities
  * UI performance for data size
  * Cross browser and screen size considerations
* Visualise the “sensor” data  
  * Impress us by visualising some/all of the sensor data 

You'll be assessed on your code quality, visual presentation and attention to detail - it's okay to use external dependencies, but we expect to see sufficient original work to be able to assess your abilities!
